# Fine-Tuning Mistral 7B Model

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and instructions for fine-tuning the Mistral 7B model for natural language processing tasks. Mistral 7B, developed by Mistral.AI, is a powerful large language model (LLM) capable of generating coherent text and performing various NLP tasks. By fine-tuning this model, we aim to enhance its performance on specific tasks using custom datasets.

## Overview of Mistral 7B Instruct-V0.2

The Mistral AI team introduces the Mistral 7B instruct-v0.2 model as a new addition to the generative AI era. Itâ€™s a language model with 7 billion parameters, offering impressive performance in both code-related and English-language tasks.

## Model Specifications

Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 is a transformer model with the following architecture choices:
- Grouped-Query Attention
- Sliding-Window Attention
- Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer

## The Importance of Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning involves using custom datasets to improve a pre-trained model's performance on specific tasks. This process updates the model's parameters to reflect acquired knowledge, making it more suitable for specific tasks. Full fine-tuning can be expensive, but methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) make it more efficient and accessible.

## Setup and Installation

Install the essential libraries required for fine-tuning the Mistral 7B model. Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date to avoid errors during the process.

## Dataset Preparation

### Loading the Dataset

First, load the dataset/story.json dataset. This dataset is a great collection of 5th-standard textbook content.

### Formatting the Dataset

Format the dataset by merging prompt and response columns into a single prompt for fine-tuning. Filter the dataset to focus on specific components and reduce the amount of training data for faster processing.

### Example Dataset Format

Here is an example format for creating your own dataset in JSON, based on a 5th standard textbook:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST]  What year is the Earth destroyed? [/INST]  It was the year 2068, humans had destroyed the Earth, and started colonising the red planet Mars. </s>"
  },

  // Additional entries as needed
]
```

This format includes a series of question-answer pairs encapsulated in a specific structure for training the model effectively.

## Model Loading and Configuration

Load the mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 base model with 4-bit quantization for efficient training. This involves reducing the memory footprint and making the model compatible with consumer GPUs.

## Training Process

### Hyperparameters

Set up the necessary configurations and hyperparameters for training, including learning rate, batch size, and evaluation strategy.

### Training the Model

Prepare the model for training with LoRA. Fine-tune the model using supervised fine-tuning techniques to adjust its weights based on task-specific loss.

## Conclusion and Future Work

This README outlines the steps to fine-tune the Mistral 7B model using LoRA and other techniques to enhance its performance on specific tasks. Future work could involve exploring additional fine-tuning methods and further optimizing the model for different use cases.
